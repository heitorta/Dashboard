A dashboard created utilizing Dash and Plotly only, consisting of 9 dataframes and two callback instances. 
The dashboard is entirely based on the game CS:GO's stats, such as weapon damage, economics and competitive scenario statistics and data.
all dataframes are located on a file called dataframes and the whole program is called DASHBOARD.py
